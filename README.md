# Dotfiles

Configuration files for my current Arch setup. Noticeable highlights:
- 24bit, 96kHz DAC Setup for PulseAudio, with better quality resampling
- Beets configuration for music library management
- Slight edit of standard polybar config
- i3-gaps setup, including commands for Firefox & graphical volume control launch and moving windows with keyboard (for GIMP)
- zsh git prompt and setup of some basic aliases 
- Alacritty opacity and size changes
